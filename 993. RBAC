What is Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)?
RBAC, or Role-Based Access Control, is a way of regulating access to computer or network resources based on users’ roles. 
In Kubernetes, RBAC is used to control what action users, groups of users, or service accounts can perform within a cluster. 
Roles define a set of permissions, and role bindings connect those roles to a particular user, group, or service account.

How to Implement RBAC in Kubernetes?
Define Roles: Create roles specifying the actions accepted on certain resources.
Create Role Bindings: Bind roles to customers, corporations, or carrier bills.
Apply Role Bindings: Apply the role bindings to the cluster the use of “kubectl apply”

Benefits of Using RBAC
Security: Restrict user permissions, restricting potential attack from unintentional or malicious actions.
Compliance: Facilitates adherence to safety guidelines and regulatory requirements.
Scalability: Easily manage access to controls as your cluster and team grow.
