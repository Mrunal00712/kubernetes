If we launch only one pod then the SPOF can occur 
when we are running same copy in pods then it is   called repica,
with the help of replica we can create a better system design

Vertical Scaling(increasing the ram, cpu of same laptop)   XX    Hrizontal scaling(increasing the no.of laptops)

Load balancing is the service/ program acts as an intermidate program(also knows as Procy program= doing this behalf of you)  between the server and clients
  - means client sending request , that request is collected by Intermidate program,
      and that program will send your req to ser , get back and sent to client 
  - Interdimate program/ proxy porgram will help you in balancing the traffic
  - this program is called as Load Balancer, behind the seen they use Round Robin algorithm in managing the traffic
  - in kubernetes you dont want to worry about the load balancing , just tell them i required LB,
      they will take care by creating the Backend servers, register them with frontend serber(Load Balancer), enore thing they will set for you
      for achieving this they have on kubernetes resource available called service resource (name is service but entire equal to Load Balancer)
      like pod is resource, rc controller is on resource like this we have service,
      kubernetes provide one service to you Cluster IP but this is not useful for us now , we can use this service to create our LB
       # kubectl get service

***************************************************************************************************************************
Their are different types of Service(==Load Balancer) are available 
How to create the service

3 Kind of Load Balancer, theree different kind of services
  1. Cluster IP
  2. Node Port
  3. External load balancer 

# kubectl expose  -h   // expose means you are using some kind of service(i.e., load balancer)


Condition: whenever you run/deploy App on POD , the client can access but some POD get down or crack using RC it can launch new
           but its IP change, so client can not connet to IT
           for this better pratice is you always use the service in between the client and POD, the service IP will be same, 
            and POD will connect to service and service IP will connect to client, always use service.

threee tpesof services(SVC)
  1. Cluster IP
  2. Node Port
  3. LB or Exyernal
which service to use it all depends upon the actual and final requirement


1. Cluster IP - Private(isolated)
  if the scerenio is that you want to deploy your POD and client can acess and the service in Same with subnet, LAB, LAN, i.e., private Ip 
  then here service is used called ClusterIP, means your client needs to connent with same network where the POD aunch, same premises
2.node port
your requirement changes, you want your app want to be access from anywhere from the entire world, this time you want to expose to 
private world + public world here we will you service as NP(node port) 

3. LB or External
when we want more relibility, more aunthocity on any of the form , what we can do we can buy the physical load balancer device
that is knows an Appliance , cliend will go there and LB will send traffic to POD

REAL Hardware or cloud computing -> AWS -> Elastic Load Balancer(ELB)
we can tell to kubernetes, now launch the POD for replication controller(RC) for replica part only but I want to use the ELB load 
balancer of the cloud computing
so any client come up they go to ELB(ver much powerful) and they will send the traffic to POD 
this is the one of the power kubernetes provide to you.
