If we launch only one pod then the SPOF can occur 
when we are running same copy in pods then it is   called repica,
with the help of replica we can create a better system design

Vertical Scaling(increasing the ram, cpu of same laptop)   XX    Hrizontal scaling(increasing the no.of laptops)

Load balancing is the service/ program acts as an intermidate program(also knows as Procy program= doing this behalf of you)  between the server and clients
  - means client sending request , that request is collected by Intermidate program,
      and that program will send your req to ser , get back and sent to client 
  - Interdimate program/ proxy porgram will help you in balancing the traffic
  - this program is called as Load Balancer, behind the seen they use Round Robin algorithm in managing the traffic
  - in kubernetes you dont want to worry about the load balancing , just tell them i required LB,
      they will take care by creating the Backend servers, register them with frontend serber(Load Balancer), enore thing they will set for you
      for achieving this they have on kubernetes resource available called service resource (name is service but entire equal to Load Balancer)
      like pod is resource, rc controller is on resource like this we have service,
      kubernetes provide one service to you Cluster IP but this is not useful for us now , we can use this service to create our LB
       # kubectl get service

***************************************************************************************************************************
Their are different types of Service(==Load Balancer) are available 
How to create the service
