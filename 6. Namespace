When we create a pod it create bydefault in defauly space,
default space is public space, where any user can see your pod, can change inside your application, can delete your pod 

this is not recommended way we deploy our application in pod & in default space thia is problem

for solving this problem we have namespace,
namespace can be understand like that we are in our home and nobody from outside can interfeare ,
namespace is an isolated space where we can create our pod , workloads and no usere can see our pod, workload without our permission
