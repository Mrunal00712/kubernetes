When we create a pod it create bydefault in defauly space,
default space is public space, where any user can see your pod, can change inside your application, can delete your pod 

this is not recommended way we deploy our application in pod & in default space thia is problem

for solving this problem we have namespace,
namespace can be understand like that we are in our home and nobody from outside can interfeare ,
namespace is an isolated space where we can create our pod , workloads and no usere can see our pod, workload without our permission


Types of namespace 
when we create a cluster k8s provide us bydeafult four namespace (1 Dafault)(2 kube-system)(3 kube-public)(4 kube-node-lease)

1. Dafault Namespace
-  open for all
-  Anybody can see and change
-  Not recommended

2. kube-system Namespace
- most important namespace, The kube-system Namespace in Kubernetes contains essential system-level components and services, 
such as kube-apiserver, etcd, kube-controller-manager, kube-scheduler, and kube-proxy. It is a special Namespace that is created 
by default when a cluster is initialized and should not be modified or deleted without careful consideration. Add-ons such as 
Kubernetes dashboard, DNS service, and monitoring tools may also be present in this Namespace. 
The kube-system Namespace provides a dedicated space for the core components of the Kubernetes system, ensuring their proper 
functioning and separation from other workloads in the cluster.

all the control plane component as a pod they are running

3. kube-public Namespace
-  Created automatically
-  Readable by all users
-  mostly reserved for cluster usage
-  in case that some resource should be visible and readable publicaly throughout the whole cluster

4. kube-node-lease Namespace
-  This namespace for the lease objects associated with each node which improves the performance of the node heartbeats as the cluster scale.
-  To deploy some monitoring and security plugins then we use this namespace.
*********************************
1. Create a namespace with name my-first-ns.
2. Create a pod with name red with image nginx in above namespace
3. Count all pods in all namespaces.
4. Permanently switch the namespace to my-first-ns.
