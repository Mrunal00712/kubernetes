What are Environment Variables?
Environment variables are dynamic values that are part of the operating system’s environment and can be accessed by various 
programs running on the system. They are used to provide configuration settings, system information and other important 
parameters to software applications.

Environment variables are typically defined by the operating system or set by the user. They are stored in a special
data structure maintained by the operating system called the environment block. Each variable has a name and a 
corresponding value, which can be retrieved by programs to access the information they represent.

The main purpose of environment variables is to provide a standardized way for programs to obtain certain 
information without requiring hard-coded values within the code itself. They enable flexibility and portability
of software applications by allowing them to adapt to different environments without the need for recompilation or modification.

For example, some commonly used environment variables include:

PATH: Specifies the directories where the operating system should look for executable files.
HOME: Indicates the user’s home directory.
TEMP or TMP: Specifies the directory where temporary files should be stored.
USER or USERNAME: Represents the username of the currently logged-in user.
OS: Indicates the name of the operating system.

Programs can read the values of these environment variables during runtime. They can also modify or 
create their own environment variables to store specific information required by the application.

Environment variables are particularly useful in scripting and automation, as they provide a convenient way
to pass parameters and configuration settings to scripts without modifying the script itself.


How to manage Environment Variables in Kubernetes?
Managing environment variables effectively in Kubernetes can greatly enhance the management of your applications. 
Here are some practices to manage environment variables within Kubernetes :

Use ConfigMaps and Secrets: Leverage ConfigMaps for non-sensitive configuration data and Secrets for sensitive 
information like credentials or API keys. Separating environment variables from the application configuration
enables easier updates and reduces the risk of exposing sensitive data.

Centralize Configuration: Instead of hardcoding Kubernetes variables in each application’s deployment configuration,
centralize the configuration in ConfigMaps or Secrets. This centralization simplifies management, promotes consistency
and enables easier updates across multiple deployments.

Avoid Sensitive Data in Plain Text: When using Secrets, avoid storing sensitive information as plain text. Instead, 
base64 encode the values to obfuscate them. While base64 encoding is not encryption, it provides a basic level of protection.
For stronger security, consider using tools like Kubernetes Secrets Store CSI Driver or external secret management systems.

Use Descriptive Names: Choose meaningful and descriptive names for your environment variables to ensure clarity and maintainability.
Clear naming conventions make it easier for developers, operators and administrators to understand the purpose and usage of Kubernetes variables.

Version Control Configurations: Store your Kubernetes configurations, including environment variables, in version control systems
like Git. This practice enables versioning, change tracking and collaboration. It ensures that environment variable changes are 
properly documented and reviewed.
