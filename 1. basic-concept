Why kubernetes over docker?
=> becaus its solving all the major 100's of problem that docker does not solve
  - Auto healing(kubernetes bydeafult has a cluster nature, one pod fails it automatically launch the container in different caontainer/pod)
  - Auto scalling
  - enterfrise support(provide extra security, firewall)
  - Hosts(multi node hosts)

kubernetes can manage 100 of things
  - monitoring conainer
  - handling the 100s of request at a time
  - if some application haveing limitat one point of time they can handele 100 request, i wiil tell the kubernetes program keep on monitoring 
    if the ram utilazation goes about 80%, may be cpu utilization goes about 90% , no. of request goes about 100 of request then launch one more OS withy same copy(= load balancing)
    you dont have to woory , load increase launch one more, one more == scaling

Kubernetes can manage entire container infrastructure, it's not the one tool other tool docker swarm, marathon,
  but with market, feature and facility , very much mature that is kubernetes 


kubernetes does not have capability to launch the application == no  XXX bt it can helps us to launch the application == yes
    kubernetes will go and contact to container engine and ask them to launch the container or app and this is managed by me(kubernetes) 


How to Install kubernetes program (Install/ setup )
  - minikube is a program who helps us to set up the kubernetes lab (windows(VM BoX(kube server))
  - kubectl is the clientside tool which passes the instruction , and whatever instruction we pass kubernetes will do for us
  - minikube is the automation tool which configure the kubernetes cluster

kubectl.exe get pods
kubectl.exe delete pods myweb
kubectl.exe create -f first_pod.yml
kubectl.exe get deploy
kubectl get pods -o wide
minikube ssh
kubectl get pods -w // means watch pod in realtime
kubectl describe pods
kubectl.exe delete pods --all

referenche == kubectl cheat sheet
docs= kubrnetes.io/docs/concept/workloads/pods/
kubernetes not lkaunch the conainer irectly first they aunch the POD inside POD they launch the container
single container pod X multi container pod
