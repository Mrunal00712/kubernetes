kubernetes can manage 100 of things
  - monitoring conainer
  - handling the 10s of request at a time
  - if some application haveing limitat one point of time they can handele 100 request, i wiil tell the kubernetes program keep on monitoring 
    if the ram utilazation goes about 80%, may be cpu utilization goes about 90% , no. of request goes about 100 of request then launch one more OS withy same copy(= load balancing)
    you dont have to woory , load increase launch one more, one more == scaling
