### DaemonSets in Kubernetes

DaemonSets in Kubernetes ensure that a copy of a specific pod runs on all (or a specified subset) of nodes in a cluster. 
As nodes are added to the cluster, pods are added to them. When nodes are removed from the cluster, those pods are garbage collected. 
Deleting a DaemonSet will clean up the pods it created.

**Example**: `kube-proxy`

**Use-Case**: Monitoring solutions, logging agents, and other system-level components.

### Detailed Guide on DaemonSets

This README provides an overview of DaemonSets in Kubernetes, including how to create, update, rollback, view, and delete DaemonSets.

#### Creating a DaemonSet

To create a DaemonSet in Kubernetes, you can use the following YAML file:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: DaemonSet
metadata:
  name: fluentd-daemonset
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: fluentd
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: fluentd
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: fluentd
        image: fluent/fluentd:latest
```

Apply the above file using the following command:
```sh
kubectl apply -f fluentd-daemonset.yaml
```

#### Viewing Running DaemonSets

To view all the running DaemonSets, use the following command:
```sh
kubectl get daemonsets
```

#### Updating a DaemonSet

To update a DaemonSet, modify the YAML file. For example, update the `fluentd-daemonset.yaml` file to use a different image version:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: DaemonSet
metadata:
  name: fluentd-daemonset
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: fluentd
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: fluentd
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: fluentd
        image: fluent/fluentd:v1.2.3
```

Apply the updated YAML file using:
```sh
kubectl apply -f fluentd-daemonset.yaml
```

To view the updated DaemonSet's pods, use:
```sh
kubectl get pods -l app=fluentd
```

#### Checking Logs Collected by Fluentd

Once you have the pod name, you can view the logs by running the following command:
```sh
kubectl logs <pod_name>
```

#### Rolling Update a DaemonSet

To rollback the DaemonSet to a previous version, use the following command:
```sh
kubectl rollout undo daemonset fluentd-daemonset
```

#### Deleting a DaemonSet

To delete the DaemonSet named `fluentd-daemonset`, use the following command:
```sh
kubectl delete daemonset fluentd-daemonset
```

### Practical Example and Commands

1. **Create a DaemonSet**:
    - Create a file named `fluentd-daemonset.yaml` with the following content:
        ```yaml
        apiVersion: apps/v1
        kind: DaemonSet
        metadata:
          name: fluentd-daemonset
        spec:
          selector:
            matchLabels:
              app: fluentd
          template:
            metadata:
              labels:
                app: fluentd
            spec:
              containers:
              - name: fluentd
                image: fluent/fluentd:latest
        ```
    - Apply the configuration:
        ```sh
        kubectl apply -f fluentd-daemonset.yaml
        ```

2. **View Running DaemonSets**:
    ```sh
    kubectl get daemonsets
    ```

3. **Update a DaemonSet**:
    - Modify the `fluentd-daemonset.yaml` file to update the image:
        ```yaml
        apiVersion: apps/v1
        kind: DaemonSet
        metadata:
          name: fluentd-daemonset
        spec:
          selector:
            matchLabels:
              app: fluentd
          template:
            metadata:
              labels:
                app: fluentd
            spec:
              containers:
              - name: fluentd
                image: fluent/fluentd:v1.2.3
        ```
    - Apply the updated configuration:
        ```sh
        kubectl apply -f fluentd-daemonset.yaml
        ```

4. **View Updated DaemonSet's Pods**:
    ```sh
    kubectl get pods -l app=fluentd
    ```

5. **Check Logs Collected by Fluentd**:
    ```sh
    kubectl logs <pod_name>
    ```

6. **Rolling Update a DaemonSet**:
    ```sh
    kubectl rollout undo daemonset fluentd-daemonset
    ```

7. **Delete a DaemonSet**:
    ```sh
    kubectl delete daemonset fluentd-daemonset
    ```

By following this guide, you can effectively manage DaemonSets in your Kubernetes cluster, ensuring system-level applications are running across all necessary nodes.

### Static Pods in Kubernetes

Static pods are managed directly by the kubelet daemon on a specific node, without the intervention of control plane components like the API server. They are defined by creating a pod manifest in a specific directory on the node, typically `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/`.

This README provides instructions on creating and managing static pods in Kubernetes.

### Creating a Static Pod

To create a static pod named "static-web" using the Nginx image, follow these steps:

1. **Create the Static Pod YAML**

    Create a YAML file named `static-web.yaml` with the following content:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: static-web
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx
    ```

2. **Verify the Successful Creation of the Static Pod**

    You can apply the pod definition using `kubectl apply` to ensure the YAML is correct, though it won't directly create a static pod this way:
    
    ```sh
    kubectl apply -f static-web.yaml
    ```

    This command is optional and used here just to verify the YAML format.

3. **Copy the Pod YAML to the Static Pod Directory**

    To create the static pod, you need to copy the `static-web.yaml` file to the directory where the kubelet looks for static pod manifests. Typically, this directory is `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/`.

    Use the following command to copy the file:

    ```sh
    sudo cp static-web.yaml /etc/kubernetes/manifests/
    ```

4. **Ensure the Pod is Started by Kubelet**

    To ensure that the pod is started by the kubelet, monitor its status using `kubectl`:

    ```sh
    kubectl get pods
    ```

    The pod's status should change to "Running," indicating that the kubelet has successfully started the static pod.

### Example Commands

Here's a step-by-step example of the commands you would run:

1. **Create the YAML file:**

    ```sh
    echo "
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: static-web
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx
    " > static-web.yaml
    ```

2. **Verify the YAML (optional):**

    ```sh
    kubectl apply -f static-web.yaml
    ```

3. **Copy the YAML to the manifests directory:**

    ```sh
    sudo cp static-web.yaml /etc/kubernetes/manifests/
    ```

4. **Monitor the pod status:**

    ```sh
    kubectl get pods
    ```

### Additional Information

- **Static Pod Location**: By default, the kubelet checks the `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/` directory for pod definitions, but this path can be configured via the kubelet's `--pod-manifest-path` flag.
  
- **Static Pod Management**: Static pods are not managed via the Kubernetes API server. Instead, they are directly managed by the kubelet, which ensures they are always running. If a static pod is deleted, the kubelet recreates it from the manifest file.

By following these steps, you can create and manage static pods in your Kubernetes cluster effectively.
